BASICS OF A RUBY PROGRAM

To print something out use 
    -> print "Steve"
    -> puts "Steve"
    When using puts, items are printed out followed by a new line. On the other hand, 
    when using print items are printed out on the same line.

DRAWING A SHAPE 
puts "   /|"
puts "  / |"
puts " /  |"
puts "/___|"
 
Ruby executes line by line. In the order written

VARIABLES
They are containers used to store data.

****
puts "There once was a man named Steve"
puts "He was a programmer"
puts "He really liked being a programmer"
puts "but didn't like the name Steve."
****

In the above I have to manually change the characters name. To solve for that we put the name in a container

character_name = "Steve"
character_job = "programmer"

****
puts ("There once was a man named " + character_name)
puts ("He was a " + character_job)
puts ("He really liked being a " + character_job)
puts ("but didn't like the name "  + character_name)
****

DATA TYPES IN RUBY
name = "Steve" -> String
age = 75  -> integer
weight = 70.9 -> float
ismale = true -> bool
flaws = nil 

WORKING WITH STRINGS
phrase = "Digikids Academy"
#string methods
puts phrase.upcase()
puts phrase.downcase()
puts phrase.strip() #removes leading and trailing spaces
puts phrase.length()
puts phrase.include? "Academy"
puts phrase[0] #Accesing characters using indexes
puts phrase[0, 4]
puts phrase.index("D")

MATH AND NUMBERS
puts 6 #prints out number 6
puts 8 + 6 #Does basic arithmetics

num = 20.907
puts ("my fav num " + num.to_s) #converts nums to string

puts num.abs()
puts num.round()
puts num.ceil()
puts num.floor()
puts Math.sqrt(36)


USER INPUT
puts "Enter your name"
name = gets

use the gets.chomp() to remove the new line.

BUILDING A MADLIBS GAME

puts "Enter a color: "
color = gets.chomp()
puts "Enter a plural_noun: "
plural_noun = gets.chomp()
puts "Enter a celebrity: "
celebrity = gets.chomp()

 
puts ("Roses are " + color)
puts (plural_noun + " are blue")
puts ("I love " + celebrity)

ARRAYS IN RUBY
Variables stores only one value. Arrays stores lots of data.

friends = Array["Kelvin", "Karen", "Oscar]
puts friends
puts friends[0] #working with array index
puts friends[-2]
puts friends[0, 2] #range of items
friends[0] = "Dorothy"
friends = Array.new #Empty array
friends.lenght()
friends.include? "Karens"
friends.reverse()
friends.sort()

HASHES 
Stores data in key:value pair

states = {
    "Pennsylvania" => "PA", 
    "New York" => "NY", 
    :Oregon => "OR"
}
puts states[:Oregon]

METHODS 
def sayhi
    puts "Hello User"
end

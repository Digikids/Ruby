  VARIABLES
They are containers used to store 
data

my_school 
my_name = "Hawee"
my_age

puts ("My name is " + my_name)
I go to _______
I am ________

    RULES WHILE NAMING VARIABLES
-> All variable names must begin with a letter of the alphabet or an undescore(_)
-> After the initial letter, variable names can also contain letters and numbers
 eg myschool 
    my8
-> Uppercase letters are distince from lowercase letters
 eg MYAGE is different from myage
    school is different from SCHOOL
-> You cannot use a KEYWORD(reseved words) as variable name
-> Variables can ONLY contain letters, numbers or undescores
    (*, %, $, @, -, +, (), )

    DATA TYPES IN RUBY
-> Numbers 
    Integers - Are whole numbers Eg 8, 9, 10
    Floating points or Floats - Are not whole numbers, They are either decimals or 
    fractions eg 1.2, 3/4
    * -> multiply
    - -> Subtract
    / -> Divide
    + -> Add
-> Strings
    Strings are a groups of letters that represent a sentence or a word
    A string is anything inside double quotation marks
-> Boolean
    They represent only one bit of information either true or false

-> Arrays
    They can contain numbers, strings and boolean values

ARRAYS IN RUBY
Variables stores only one value. Arrays can store more than one value    

******IF STATEMENTS******
I wake up 
If I'm hungry
    I eat breakfast

I leave my house
If its cloudy
    I bring an umbrella

I'm at the restaurant
If i want meat
    I order a steak

For an if statement to execute the condition must be true
= (assignment)
==, >, <, <=, >=, != (comparisons)

and -> is used when both the statements must be true
or -> is used when one of the statements must be true, atleast one 
        statement should be true

Functions
They are "self contined" modules of code that accomplish a specific task. Functions
usually 'take in' data, process it, and 'return' a result. Once a function is 
written, it can be used over and over and over again.
Functions can be called from the inside of other functions

Loops
Loops in Ruby are used to execute the same block of code a specified number of times.
While Loops
while condition [do]
    code
end
A while loop's condition is separated from the code by the reserved word do.


Quiz
1. Write a function calculation() such that it can accept two 
    variables and calculate their product.

2. Create a function showStudent() in such a way that it should 
    accept age, and Subtract it from 10 and display the output.

3. Print the numbers between 40 and 60 using while loop

4. Given a list, iterate it, and display numbers divisible by 3. 
    HINT -> The modulus should be 0 if the number is divisible by three.

5.  Write code to display numbers from 20 to 10 using loop in decending order

6.  Use a while loop to print the following pattern (20lines)

* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * * * 
* * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * * * 

1. Write code to display numbers from 10 to 1 using for loop in decending order
2. Write a program to display all odd numbers from 0 to 80
3. Given a two list of numbers create a new list such that new list should contain only odd 
	numbers from the first list and even numbers from the second list
	list1 =  [10, 20, 23, 11, 17]
    list2 = [13, 43, 24, 36, 12] #Use the append
4. Display a message “Done” after successful execution of for loop
5. Write a program to display all prime numbers within 0 to 100
6. Given an array of numbers. Turn every item of that array into its square 
    Hint -> A square of a number is that number multiplied by itself
7. Create a ruby function that generates a ruby array of all the even numbers between 4 to 30

def calculation(num1, num2)
    puts(num1*num2)
    puts(num1/num2)
end
calculation(30,3)

def showStudent(StudentName, StudentAge)
    puts("The students name is " + StudentName + "and their age is " + StudentAge.to_s)
end

showStudent("Hawee", 45)

i = 50
while i < 200
    puts(i)
    i += 1
end

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
for i in numbers do
    if i % 4 == 0
        puts(i)
    end
end

i = 10
while i > 0
    puts(i)
    i -= 1
end

n = 1
while n <= 10
    puts "* " * n
    n += 1
end
